        Me and my girl friend share a very unique vocabulary. I feel this is common
        with any two people who're just utterly in love with each other. To pay homage
        to such relationships I created this platform.
        <br /><br />
        We have a substack where we talk about relationship — and we have a service
        dedicated to making the relationship work for each other.
        <br /><br />
        When you sign up with us — you <em>HAVE</em> to make something custom for the
        other person. We emphasis on this as we belive this is how we make long-term
        relationships — by telling each other how and why the other person means
        something to you.
